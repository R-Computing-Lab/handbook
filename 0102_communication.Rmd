## Communication within the lab

###  Lab Meetings

Lab members participate in both regular and ad hoc meetings. These meetings may involve everyone or just subgroups. If you have been asked to participate in a meeting, it is because you are a vital part of that project group. If you cannot attend, you should tell the group leader in advance. Remember, however, that the group may no longer be able to carry out the intended work without your presence, so skip meetings sparingly. 

If you do not appear at a meeting as expected and have not informed anyone in advance, it will be assumed that you have been abducted by aliens, and a search-and-rescue mission will be organized. I will draw [inspiration](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-swedish-professor-helped-rescue-grad-student-isis-controlled-iraq-n947866) from Prof. Charlotta Turner of Lund University.

All meetings begin and end on time, if not earlier. Don't be afraid to remind me of this if/when I am the offending party. It is important that we all respect each other's time.




### Wiki

The lab wiki is our shared collection of knowledge about how to get things done in the lab. The lab handbook you are reading now is "top down", in that I am writing the whole thing myself. By contrast the wiki is a shared resource to which everyone can—and should—contribute. A good rule of thumb is that if you need to figure out how to do something, someone else in the lab may someday need to do the same thing. Whenever possible please document what you figure out on the wiki, including updating old sections which may no longer be relevant. Please encourage each other (and those working with you) to do the same! (And me, please remind me!)

## Conferences

Conferences are excellent opportunities to present your research, make connections, and learn about new research and methods from others. If possible, I recommend attending two or more conferences while you are a graduate student at Wake Forest and presenting your research at one or more of the conferences you attend.
