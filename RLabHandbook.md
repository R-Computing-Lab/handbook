# (PART\*) Front Matter {-}

# Preamble  {-}



The R Computing Lab is directed by Prof. Mason Garrison. Our lab houses scientists who conduct biometrically-informed research in R. Our research addresses a mixture of substantive and methodological questions. We're part of the MegaLab with Prof. Veronica Cole!

# Attributions {-}
I have heavily adapted pieces from other lab manuals/handbooks. I will do my best to properly attribute sources. However, I strongly suspect that as this document grows and develops attributions will be harder and harder to keep track of. 

This document leans heavily on other peoples' materials and ideas. I have done my best to document the origin of the materials and ideas. In particular, I have noted those people whose work has been a major contribution as well as those who have additional contributions. You can see specific changes by examining the [edit history on the git repo][commits]

# (PART) Introductions {-}




# Who R we?


The R Computing Lab is directed by Prof. Mason Garrison. Our lab houses scientists who conduct biometrically-informed research in R. Our research addresses a mixture of substantive and methodological questions. We're part of the MegaLab with Prof. Veronica Cole!

Our substantive work focuses understanding the relationships between socioeconomic status, health & well-being, and individual differences (personality, intelligence). Our methodological work focuses on developing and improving biometrically-informed designs, such as behavior genetic and discordant kin models. Much of the research in my lab is student-driven, so the specific content questions will meander within that broad topic. :)

Students in the laboratory work on projects covering a wide range of topics, including inter-generational consequences of divorce, vaccination willingness, R package development.


My goal is to foster an inclusive, equitable, welcoming, and accessible lab environment, where EVERY member of the lab can thrive. I am convinced that supportive labs produce better science and scientists. I want you to feel welcomed, supported, valued, and respected. I want you to thrive.

# (PART) Being in the lab {-}



# Being in the lab

Ok, so what does it mean to be part of the R computing lab? Well, let's start with my goals and expectations.


My goal is to foster an inclusive, equitable, welcoming, and accessible lab environment, where EVERY member of the lab can thrive. I am convinced that supportive labs produce better science and scientists. I want you to feel welcomed, supported, valued, and respected. I want you to thrive. 

This handbook is a first point of reference for current lab members as we strive to achieve these goals, and serves as a general introduction for prospective members. 


## Everyone

Generally, don't be an asshole. 

### You won't know everything

Ask questions! It is ok to not know something. I don't know everything. It is the sign of a good scholar to ask questions and it is the sign of a confident scholar to be willing to say that they don't know.

### Work-Life Balance

We value work-life balance.


## Mason
You can expect me to:

- Have a vision of where the lab is going.
- Care about your happiness, health, and well-being.
- Obtain the funding to support the science and the people in the lab.
- Track down interesting sources of data.
- Support you in your career development (regardless of whether you plan to stay in research), including: 
    - writing letters of recommendation,
    - introductions to other scientists, 
    - subsidizing conference travel, and 
    - promoting your work as often and as shamelessly as possible.

- Support you in your personal growth, including (but not limited to):
    - giving you flexibility in working hours and environment, and 
    - encouraging you to do things other than science.

- Treat you to coffee and keep the snack drawer filled.

- Make the time to meet with you regularly, read through your manuscripts, and talk about science.



## Graduate Students

I expect graduate students to:
- Know the literature related to their topic.
- Seek out and apply for fellowships and awards (including travel awards, etc.).
- Realize there are (extraordinarily rare) times for pulling all nighters, and times for leaving early to go to the park and enjoy the sunshine.

By the time you're done, you will have to know how to do statistics and plots in R, share your work with me using Rmarkdown, use mplus for latent variable modeling and use github for version control analyses.

The learning curve can be a little steep on these but it's well worth it. (If these learning outcomes aren't compatible with your goals or interests, my lab is probably not a good fit for you!)




## Undergraduate Students

I expect undergraduates to be utterly reliable and willing to help with whatever projects need it. At a bare minimum, reliability includes showing up on time and making sure that all of your work is accurate (double-check everything). If you find yourself without a specific project:

- Ask around to see if you can help with anything.
- Look on the wiki under "Essential lab skills" and spend some time learning something new.
- Look on the giant lab todo list for either a wiki page that needs creating/updating, or other miscellaneous lab tasks that need to be done.

There is enough to do that you should not be bored!

Your first semester in the lab is an opportunity to see whether continuing in the lab is a good fit; after your first semester we will meet and discuss whether you will continue.



### Honors Students

### Independent study




## University Policies
### Employee guidelines
### Sexual harassment

### Ways to get ahold of Mason

Here are my secret [Calendly links](https://calendly.com/smasongarrison/).




###  Lab Meetings

Lab members participate in both regular and ad hoc meetings. These meetings may involve everyone or just subgroups. If you have been asked to participate in a meeting, it is because you are a vital part of that project group. If you cannot attend, you should tell the group leader in advance. Remember, however, that the group may no longer be able to carry out the intended work without your presence, so skip meetings sparingly. 

If you do not appear at a meeting as expected and have not informed anyone in advance, it will be assumed that you have been abducted by aliens, and a search-and-rescue mission will be organized. I will draw [inspiration](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-swedish-professor-helped-rescue-grad-student-isis-controlled-iraq-n947866) from Prof. Charlotta Turner of Lund University.

All meetings begin and end on time, if not earlier. Don't be afraid to remind me of this if/when I am the offending party. It is important that we all respect each other's time.




### Wiki

The lab wiki is our shared collection of knowledge about how to get things done in the lab. The lab handbook you are reading now is "top down", in that I am writing the whole thing myself. By contrast the wiki is a shared resource to which everyone canâand shouldâcontribute. A good rule of thumb is that if you need to figure out how to do something, someone else in the lab may someday need to do the same thing. Whenever possible please document what you figure out on the wiki, including updating old sections which may no longer be relevant. Please encourage each other (and those working with you) to do the same! (And me, please remind me!)



### Email

### Calendars


## Communication outside the lab

This section concerns general suggests and wisdom in communication. In the practical science section, I've included rmarkdown templates and practical advice.

### Social Media
### Presentations
#### Talks
#### Posters

### Manuscripts

## Conferences

Conferences are excellent opportunities to present your research, make connections, and learn about new research and methods from others. If possible, I recommend attending two or more conferences while you are a graduate student at Wake Forest and presenting your research at one or more of the conferences you attend.

# Science
## Big picture science
### Scientific integrity


You have a responsibility to me, the institutions that support our work, and the broader scientific community to uphold the highest standards of scientific accuracy and integrity. By being in the lab you agree to adhere to professional ethical standards. There is never an excuse for fabricating or misrepresenting data. If you have any questions, or in the unlikely event that you have concerns about a research practice you have seen in the lab, please talk to me immediately. It is also important that you prioritize the accuracy of your work while in the lab. Unintentional errors due to inattentiveness or rushing can be extremely damaging and produce results that turn out to be incorrect. Although there is always a pressure for a high quantity of research, it is critical that everything we do is of the highest quality. Please double-check your work frequently. In many cases multiple people will double-check a data set to ensure no mistakes have crept in along the way.

```
### Computers and data
### Authorship

My general philosophy is to be generous and provide ample opportunity for members of the lab to earn authorship. Authorship on an academic work is a ["public acknowledgment of scientific or professional contribution"](https://www.apa.org/science/leadership/students/authorship-paper). Although the criteria for authorship differ slightly across fields, the general question asked is whether this individual made a meaningful contribution to the work. I tend to ask myself had this potential author not been involved in the project, would the final product differed substantially? If the answer to that counter-factual is yes, then I believe that person has earned authorship.

#### Order of Authors

In psychology, the order of authors reflects their relative contribution. Other fields have different conventions, such as economics tends to alphabetize authors. However, psychology and other lab-based fields don't merely rank authors. Instead the authorship order resembles a 'U' where first and last authors indicate the most substantial contributions and authors in the middle reflect relatively smaller contributions. Practically speaking, this ordering means that I (Mason) will probably be last author, and any project that you, dear reader, lead are first author.

# (PART) Style Guides {-}



# APA

## Bias-Free Language

> The American Psychological Association emphasizes the need to talk about all people with inclusivity and respect. Writers using APA Style must strive to use language that is free of bias and avoid perpetuating prejudicial beliefs or demeaning attitudes in their writing. Just as you have learned to check what you write for spelling, grammar, and wordiness, practice reading your work for bias.
> 
> The guidelines for bias-free language contain both general guidelines for writing about people without bias across a range of topics and specific guidelines that address the individual characteristics of age, disability, gender, participation in research, racial and ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. These guidelines and recommendations were crafted by panels of experts on APAâs bias-free language committees.
Inclusive and bias free-language. 

[Source](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language)


## Inclusive Writing

See this recent document from the APA about using [inclusive](https://www.apa.org/about/apa/equity-diversity-inclusion/language-guidelines.pdf) and [bias-free](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/general-principles) language. The APA recently added an entire section on the [disability-community](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/disability). Also, the National Center on Disability and Journalism has an inclusive [style guide](https://ncdj.org/style-guide/).

# Useful Copy-editing Resources

These resources are useful for copyediting, readability, and academic phrasing. Often these use NLP.

## Software and Widgets
- Grammarly
- [Writefull](https://www.writefull.com/)
- [Writefull's Title Generator](https://x.writefull.com/title-generator/index.html)
- [Writefull's Academic Paraphraser](https://x.writefull.com/paraphraser/index.html)
- [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/)



# R Style Guide

The goal of this Programming Style Guide is to make the lab's R code more consistent and easier to work with. This guide is based on the Tidyverse Style Guide by Hadley Wickham [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/). It differs in a few ways, and provides much more detail on variables names for the NLSY.

## NLSY Variable Names

Please use the variable renamer function

## Userscripts

What are user scripts?

User scripts put you in control of your browsing experience. Once installed, they automatically make the sites you visit better by adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits. The user scripts on Greasy Fork were written by other users and posted to share with the world. They're free to install and easy to use.

# Remote Access




## Steps

1. You will need to be sure you have the WFU VPN Client software (Cisco Anyconnect Mobility) installed - if you don't already have it, you can install it from software.wfu.edu (and probably this specific link: https://software.wfu.edu/download/wfu-vpn/). 


2. You will also need to have the Microsoft Remote Desktop software installed. You should already have this as part of MS Office. If on a Mac, you won't have it probably, but can get it free through the app store. 



3. You will sign into VPN (using the client software mentioned above). 


4. To sign in, you should enter your ID and password. For example, if your email address is " Gravity21@wfu.edu" and your password is "11111111" you should key in "Gravity21" and "11111111"


5. Once connected through VPN, you need to open the Microsoft Remote Desktop software and key in the IP address that you already received.

## Troubleshooting

In case Cisco Anyconnect isn't working, try these resources.

# (PART) Professional Development {-}




# Future Directions!

This section gathers together some professional development resources I've gathered throughout my career. The collections are currently divided into Graduate School Applications and Academic Job Search. Clearly, there's much to add in between those two stages. 

<!--chapter:end:0900_development.Rmd-->



# Graduate School Admissions Advice

## Motivation

Here are an incomplete collection of resources for students interested in applying to graduate school in psychology. I've included my application materials that I used for the PhD program I enrolled in. NOTE: I really feel that I was accepted in spite of my application essay. However, in the spirit of transparency, I've included it anyway.

# Career Resources

## Motivation

I had a tough time finding examples of job materials for quantitatively-inclined candidates. Here are representative examples from my own materials. Hopefully, they'll be able to help inspire your own materials. In addition, I've added some of the other resources and information that I found helpful. Although this collection has focused on academic jobs, I also considered industry jobs in my search.
