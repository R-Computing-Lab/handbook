## I've spotted a mistake or would like to contribute

Please [open a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Better yet, please fork the repo and [submit an upstream pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). I'm very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond while this course is still be developed. Similarly, I am unlikely to help with software troubleshooting or conceptual difficulties for non-enrolled students. Others may feel free to jump in, though. Additionally, if you'd like to contribute, but don't have something specific in mind, feel free to check out the issues section for potential ideas.
