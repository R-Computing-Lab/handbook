# Attribution {-}
I have heavily adapted pieces from other lab manuals/handbooks. I will do my best to properly attribute sources. However, I strongly suspect that as this document grows and develops attributions will be harder and harder to keep track of. 

This document leans heavily on other peoples' materials and ideas. I have done my best to document the origin of the materials and ideas. In particular, I have noted those people whose work has been a major contribution as well as those who have additional contributions. You can see specific changes by examining the [edit history on the git repo][commits]

# Colophon {-}

These notes was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The [website][web] is hosted with [github](https://www.github.com), The complete source is available from [github][git].

The book style adapted from designs by [Desir√©e De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/).

This version of the notes was built with:

```{r message = FALSE,error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(path = "DESCRIPTION") %>% 
  pull(Package) 

session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)

session$platform
```

Along with these packages:

```{r message = FALSE,error=TRUE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = nrow(session$packages), 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = FALSE))
