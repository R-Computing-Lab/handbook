# Graduate Student Professional Development

### General Timeline

The timeline below is intended to help you structure your time during the WFU graduate program -- to stay on track with: 
- non-coursework program requirements, 
- professional development opportunities (conferences), and 
- PhD applications, if you plan to apply. 

It likely not comprehensive for your unique situation, and it is expected that you will personalize it. This timeline was orinally written by [The AMAZING Shannon Brady](https://psychology.wfu.edu/about-the-department/faculty-and-staff/shannon-brady/). I've tweaked it and added to it. But she really deserves credit for it.
