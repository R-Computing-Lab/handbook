This lab doesn't collect fresh data. We use archival data that others have collected. 

## Sources in general

### Publicly Available Data

I have a sampling listed here. The main list is in the [Secondary Dataset Repositories][https://osf.io/ra8yg/wiki/home/]

#### Government Data


##### NLSY

[National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY)] contains 4 generations of data and a replication sample that is nationally representative of the united states. It's got tons of good stuff in it. And is a staple data set in the lab for sibling comparison designs.  

The [NLSY79 topical guide](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79/topical-guide) is a good place to get started.
