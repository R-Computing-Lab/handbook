Mason Garrison 2021-05-20 Welcome to our R Computing Lab and R Lab Handbook The R Computing Lab houses scientists who conduct biometrically-informed research in R. Our research addresses a mixture of substantive and methodological questions. Were part of the MegaLab with Veronica Cole! Our substantive work focuses understanding the relationships between socioeconomic status, health &amp; well-being, and individual differences (personality, intelligence). Our methodological work focuses on developing and improving biometrically-informed designs, such as behavior genetic and discordant kin models. Students in the laboratory work on projects covering a wide range of topics including inter-generational consequences of divorce, vaccination willingness, R package development. Mason Notes This website is constantly changing and often in active development. I have made this process explicitly transparent because I want you to see how you can use R to produce some pretty neat things. Indeed, Ive included the source code for this website in the class github. I encourage you to contribute to the course code. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes. If you find cool / useful resources, please add them. How to use these notes This document is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, youll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page. The document will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester. Although these notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give you all a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes do things outside the notes. The idea here is that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you would attend classes and try to learn from them.

Link Preview What is Data Science @ Oreilly Data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution. They are inherently interdiscplinary. They can tackle all aspects of a problem, from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions. They can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem, or to work with very broadly defined problems: heres a lot of data, what can you make from it? What is Data Science @ Quora Data Science is a combination of a number of aspects of Data such as Technology, Algorithm development, and data interference to study the data, analyze it, and find innovative solutions to difficult problems. Basically Data Science is all about Analyzing data and driving for business growth by finding creative ways. The sexiest job of 21st century Data scientists today are akin to Wall Street quants of the 1980s and 1990s. In those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds, where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies. Then a variety of universities developed masters programs in financial engineering, which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms. The pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers, whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs. Wikipedia Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. How to Become a Data Scientist Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientists role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations. a very short history of #datascience The story of how data scientists became sexy is mostly the story of the coupling of the mature discipline of statistics with a very young onecomputer science. The term Data Science has emerged only recently to specifically designate a new profession that is expected to make sense of the vast stores of big data. But making sense of data has a long history and has been discussed by scientists, statisticians, librarians, computer scientists and others for years. The following timeline traces the evolution of the term Data Science and its use, attempts to define it, and related terms. 2.2 Course structure and some other useful things You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below.

You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. I recommend installing R, Rstudio, git, and github before starting activity 02 4.1 R and RStudio 4.1.1 Install R and RStudio library(vembedr) embed_url(&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVIZGCT5p9U&quot;) %&gt;% use_align(&quot;center&quot;) Install R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system  use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above! Install RStudios IDE (stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user interface for R. Get the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop. You can run either the Preview version or the official releases available here. RStudio comes with a text editor, so there is no immediate need to install a separate stand-alone editor. RStudio can interface with Git(Hub). However, you must do all the Git(Hub) set up described elsewhere before you can take advantage of this. If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, I highly recommend that you reinstall both and get as current as possible. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new. If you upgrade R, you will need to update any packages you have installed. The command below should get you started, though you may need to specify more arguments if, e.g., you have been using a non-default library for your packages. update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE) Note: this code will only look for updates on CRAN. So if you use a package that lives only on GitHub or if you want a development version from GitHub, you will need to update manually, e.g. via devtools::install_github(). 4.1.2 Testing testing Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see here, but yours will be more boring because you havent written any code or made any figures yet! Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like x &lt;- 3 * 4 (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the x object by typing x followed by enter or return. You should see the value 12 print to screen. If yes, youve succeeded in installing R and RStudio. 4.1.3 Add-on packages R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a package via CRAN and GitHub. To install a package from CRAN, for example the dplyr package for data manipulation, here is one way to do it in the R console (there are others). install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) By including dependencies = TRUE, we are being explicit and extra-careful to install any additional packages the target package, dplyr in the example above, needs to have around. You could use the above method to install the following packages, all of which we will use: tidyr, package webpage ggplot2, package webpage 4.1.4 Further resources The above will get your basic setup ready but here are some links if you are interested in reading a bit further.

The compiled version should look something like the following "],["thoughtful-workflow.html", "6 Thoughtful Workflow 6.1 R Markdown 6.2 Git and Github 6.3 Getting Help with R", " 6 Thoughtful Workflow At this point, I recommend you pause and think about your workflow. I give you permission to spend some time and energy sorting this out! It can be as or more important than learning a new R function or package. The experts dont talk about this much, because theyve already got a workflow; its something they do almost without thinking. Working through subsequent material in R Markdown documents, possibly using Git and GitHub to track and share your progress, is a great idea and will leave you more prepared for your future data analysis projects. Typing individual lines of R code is but a small part of data analysis and it pays off to think holistically about your workflow. If you want a lot more detail on workflows, you can wander over to the optional bit on r basics and workflow. 6.1 R Markdown If you are in the mood to be entertained, start the video from the beginning. But if youd rather just get on with it, start watching at 6:52. You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. R Markdown is a very accessible way to create computational documents that combine prose and tables and figures produced by R code. An introductory R Markdown workflow, including how it intersects with Git, GitHub, and RStudio, is now maintained within the Happy Git site: Test drive R Markdown 6.2 Git and Github XKCD on Git First, its important to realize that Git and GitHub are distinct things. GitHub is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system. (Similar platforms include Bitbucket and GitLab.) Just like we dont need Rstudio to run R code, we dont need GitHub to use Git But, it will make our lives so much easier. I recommend checking out Jenny Bryans instructions around installation, setup, and early Git usage with her book Happy Git with R. I have provided a optional deep dive in a later chapter](#happygit). You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. 6.2.1 What is Github? 6.2.2 Git Git is a distributed version control system. (Wait, what?) Okay, try this: Imagine if Dropbox and the Track changes feature in MS Word had a baby. Git would be that baby. In fact, its even better than that because Git is optimized for the things that social scientists and data scientists spend a lot of time working on (e.g. code). The learning curve is worth it  I promise you. Git and GitHubs role in global software development is not in question. - Theres a high probability that your favorite app, program or package is built using Git-based tools. (RStudio is a case in point.) Scientists and academic researchers are cottoning on too. Benefits of version control and collaboration tools aside, Git(Hub) helps to operationalize the ideals of open science and reproducibility. Journals have increasingly strict requirements regarding reproducibility and data access. GH makes this easy (DOI integration, off-the-shelf licenses, etc.). I run my entire lab on GH; this entire course is running on github; these lecture notes are hosted on github 6.3 Getting Help with R You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below.
