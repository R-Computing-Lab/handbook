Our research addresses a mixture of substantive and methodological questions. Were part of the MegaLab with Veronica Cole! Welcome to our R Lab Handbook My goal is to foster an environment of consistent scientific excellence and personal development that supports every lab member in reaching their full potential, and helps us have fun while doing great science. I want you to be happy and productive while you are here. This handbook is a first point of reference for current lab members as we strive to achieve these goals, and serves as a general introduction for prospective members. You can also find the lab elsewhere:  Lab Github: https://github.com/R-Computing-Lab - Lab Wiki How to use this handbook This handbook is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, youll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page.

Our substantive work focuses understanding the relationships between socioeconomic status, health &amp; well-being, and individual differences (personality, intelligence). Our methodological work focuses on developing and improving biometrically-informed designs, such as behavior genetic and discordant kin models.

Care about your happiness. Obtain the funding to support the science and the people in the lab. Track down interesting sources of data. Support you in your career development (regardless of whether you plan to stay in research), including: writing letters of recommendation, introductions to other scientists, subsidizing conference travel, and promoting your work as often and as shamelessly as possible. Support you in your personal growth, including (but not limited to): giving you flexibility in working hours and environment, and encouraging you to do things other than science. Treat you to coffee and keep the snack drawer filled. Make the time to meet with you regularly, read through your manuscripts, and talk about science. 4.3 Graduate Students I expect graduate students to: - Know the literature related to their topic like the back of their hand. - Seek out and apply for fellowships and awards (including travel awards, etc.). - Realize there are (extraordinarily rare) times for pulling all nighters, and times for leaving early to go to the park and enjoy the sunshine. By the time youre done, you will have to know how to do statistics and plots in R, share your work with me using Rmarkdown, use mplus for latent variable modeling and use github for version control analyses. The learning curve can be a little steep on these but its well worth it. (If these learning outcomes arent compatible with your goals or interests, my lab is probably not a good fit for you!) 4.3.1 General Timeline The timeline below is intended to help you structure your time during the WFU graduate program  to stay on track with: - non-coursework program requirements, - professional development opportunities (conferences), and - PhD applications, if you plan to apply.

At a bare minimum, reliability includes showing up on time and making sure that all of your work is accurate (double-check everything). If you find yourself without a specific project: Ask around to see if you can help with anything. Look on the wiki under Essential lab skills and spend some time learning something new. Look on the giant lab todo list for either a wiki page that needs creating/updating, or other miscellaneous lab tasks that need to be done. There is enough to do that you should not be bored! Your first semester in the lab is an opportunity to see whether continuing in the lab is a good fit; after your first semester we will meet and discuss whether you will continue. 4.4.1 Honors Students 4.4.2 Independent study 4.5 University Policies 4.5.1 Employee guidelines 4.5.2 Sexual harassment "],["communication.html", "5 Communication 5.1 Communication within the lab 5.2 Communication outside the lab 5.3 Conferences", " 5 Communication 5.1 Communication within the lab 5.1.1 My doors 5.1.2 Ways to get ahold of Mason Here are my secret Calendly links. 5.1.3 Lab Meetings Lab members participate in both regular and ad hoc meetings. These meetings may involve everyone or just subgroups. If you have been asked to participate in a meeting, it is because you are a vital part of that project group. If you cannot attend, you should tell the group leader in advance. Remember, however, that the group may no longer be able to carry out the intended work without your presence, so skip meetings sparingly. If you do not appear at a meeting as expected and have not informed anyone in advance, it will be assumed that you have been abducted by aliens, and a search-and-rescue mission will be organized. I will draw inspiration from Prof. Charlotta Turner of Lund University. All meetings begin and end on time, if not earlier. Dont be afraid to remind me of this if/when I am the offending party. It is important that we all respect each others time. 5.1.4 Wiki The lab wiki is our shared collection of knowledge about how to get things done in the lab. The lab handbook you are reading now is top down, in that I am writing the whole thing myself. By contrast the wiki is a shared resource to which everyone canand shouldcontribute. A good rule of thumb is that if you need to figure out how to do something, someone else in the lab may someday need to do the same thing. Whenever possible please document what you figure out on the wiki, including updating old sections which may no longer be relevant. Please encourage each other (and those working with you) to do the same!

Authorship on an academic work is a public acknowledgment of scientific or professional contribution. Although the criteria for authorship differ slightly across fields, the general question asked is whether this individual made a meaningful contribution to the work. I tend to ask myself had this potential author not been involved in the project, would the final product differed substantially? If the answer to that counter-factual is yes, then I believe that person has earned authorship. 6.2.3.1 Order of Authors In psychology, the order of authors reflects their relative contribution. Other fields have different conventions, such as economics tends to alphabetize authors. However, psychology and other lab-based fields dont merely rank authors. Instead the authorship order resembles a U where first and last authors indicate the most substantial contributions and authors in the middle reflect relatively smaller contributions. Practically speaking, this ordering means that I (Mason) will probably be last author, and any project that you, dear reader, lead are first author.
