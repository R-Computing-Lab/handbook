The R Computing Lab is directed by Prof. Mason Garrison. Our lab houses scientists who conduct biometrically-informed research in R. Our research addresses a mixture of substantive and methodological questions. Were part of the MegaLab with Prof. Veronica Cole! Our substantive work focuses understanding the relationships between socioeconomic status, health &amp; well-being, and individual differences (personality, intelligence). Our methodological work focuses on developing and improving biometrically-informed designs, such as behavior genetic and discordant kin models. Much of the research in my lab is student-driven, so the specific content questions will meander within that broad topic. :) Students in the laboratory work on projects covering a wide range of topics, including inter-generational consequences of divorce, vaccination willingness, R package development. My goal is to foster an inclusive, equitable, welcoming, and accessible lab environment, where EVERY memember of the lab can thrive. I strongly believe that supportive labs produce better science and scientists. I want you to feel welcomed, supported, valued, and respected. I want you to thrive.

Well, lets start with my goals and expectations. My goal is to foster an inclusive, equitable, welcoming, and accessible lab environment, where EVERY memember of the lab can thrive. I strongly believe that supportive labs produce better science and scientists. I want you to feel welcomed, supported, valued, and respected. I want you to thrive. This handbook is a first point of reference for current lab members as we strive to achieve these goals, and serves as a general introduction for prospective members. 2.1 Everyone Generally, dont be an asshole. 2.1.1 You wont know everything Ask questions! It is ok to not know something. I dont know everything. It is the sign of a good scholar to ask questions and it is the sign of a confident scholar to be willing to say that they dont know. 2.1.2 Work-Life Balance We value work-life balance. 2.2 Mason You can expect me to: Have a vision of where the lab is going. Care about your happiness, health, and well-being. Obtain the funding to support the science and the people in the lab. Track down interesting sources of data. Support you in your career development (regardless of whether you plan to stay in research), including: writing letters of recommendation, introductions to other scientists, subsidizing conference travel, and promoting your work as often and as shamelessly as possible. Support you in your personal growth, including (but not limited to): giving you flexibility in working hours and environment, and encouraging you to do things other than science. Treat you to coffee and keep the snack drawer filled. Make the time to meet with you regularly, read through your manuscripts, and talk about science. 2.3 Graduate Students I expect graduate students to: - Know the literature related to their topic. - Seek out and apply for fellowships and awards (including travel awards, etc.). - Realize there are (extraordinarily rare) times for pulling all nighters, and times for leaving early to go to the park and enjoy the sunshine. By the time youre done, you will have to know how to do statistics and plots in R, share your work with me using Rmarkdown, use mplus for latent variable modeling and use github for version control analyses. The learning curve can be a little steep on these but its well worth it. (If these learning outcomes arent compatible with your goals or interests, my lab is probably not a good fit for you!) 2.4 Undergraduate Students I expect undergraduates to be utterly reliable and willing to help with whatever projects need it. At a bare minimum, reliability includes showing up on time and making sure that all of your work is accurate (double-check everything). If you find yourself without a specific project: Ask around to see if you can help with anything. Look on the wiki under Essential lab skills and spend some time learning something new. Look on the giant lab todo list for either a wiki page that needs creating/updating, or other miscellaneous lab tasks that need to be done. There is enough to do that you should not be bored! Your first semester in the lab is an opportunity to see whether continuing in the lab is a good fit; after your first semester we will meet and discuss whether you will continue. 2.4.1 Honors Students 2.4.2 Independent study 2.5 University Policies 2.5.1 Employee guidelines 2.5.2 Sexual harassment "],["communication.html", "3 Communication 3.1 Communication within the lab 3.2 Communication outside the lab 3.3 Conferences", " 3 Communication 3.1 Communication within the lab 3.1.1 My doors 3.1.2 Ways to get ahold of Mason Here are my secret Calendly links. 3.1.3 Lab Meetings Lab members participate in both regular and ad hoc meetings. These meetings may involve everyone or just subgroups. If you have been asked to participate in a meeting, it is because you are a vital part of that project group. If you cannot attend, you should tell the group leader in advance. Remember, however, that the group may no longer be able to carry out the intended work without your presence, so skip meetings sparingly. If you do not appear at a meeting as expected and have not informed anyone in advance, it will be assumed that you have been abducted by aliens, and a search-and-rescue mission will be organized. I will draw inspiration from Prof. Charlotta Turner of Lund University. All meetings begin and end on time, if not earlier. Dont be afraid to remind me of this if/when I am the offending party. It is important that we all respect each others time. 3.1.4 Wiki The lab wiki is our shared collection of knowledge about how to get things done in the lab. The lab handbook you are reading now is top down, in that I am writing the whole thing myself. By contrast the wiki is a shared resource to which everyone canand shouldcontribute. A good rule of thumb is that if you need to figure out how to do something, someone else in the lab may someday need to do the same thing. Whenever possible please document what you figure out on the wiki, including updating old sections which may no longer be relevant. Please encourage each other (and those working with you) to do the same! (And me, please remind me!) 3.1.5 Email 3.1.6 Calendars 3.2 Communication outside the lab This section concerns general suggests and wisdom in communication. In the practical science section, Ive included rmarkdown templates and practical advice. 3.2.1 Social Media 3.2.2 Presentations 3.2.2.1 Talks 3.2.2.2 Posters 3.2.3 Manuscripts 3.3 Conferences Conferences are excellent opportunities to present your research, make connections, and learn about new research and methods from others. If possible, I recommend attending two or more conferences while you are a graduate student at Wake Forest and presenting your research at one or more of the conferences you attend. Demystifying conference attendance was a motivation we had to write this article!

By being in the lab you agree to adhere to professional ethical standards. There is never an excuse for fabricating or misrepresenting data. If you have any questions, or in the unlikely event that you have concerns about a research practice you have seen in the lab, please talk to me immediately. It is also important that you prioritize the accuracy of your work while in the lab. Unintentional errors due to inattentiveness or rushing can be extremely damaging and produce results that turn out to be incorrect. Although there is always a pressure for a high quantity of research, it is critical that everything we do is of the highest quality. Please double-check your work frequently. In many cases multiple people will double-check a data set to ensure no mistakes have crept in along the way. 4.1.2 Open, accurate, and reproducible science 4.1.2.1 Open science 4.1.2.2 Accurate science I just completed a formal paper correction on my first first-authored publication.

Authorship on an academic work is a public acknowledgment of scientific or professional contribution. Although the criteria for authorship differ slightly across fields, the general question asked is whether this individual made a meaningful contribution to the work. I tend to ask myself had this potential author not been involved in the project, would the final product differed substantially? If the answer to that counter-factual is yes, then I believe that person has earned authorship. 4.2.3.1 Order of Authors In psychology, the order of authors reflects their relative contribution. Other fields have different conventions, such as economics tends to alphabetize authors. However, psychology and other lab-based fields dont merely rank authors. Instead the authorship order resembles a U where first and last authors indicate the most substantial contributions and authors in the middle reflect relatively smaller contributions. Practically speaking, this ordering means that I (Mason) will probably be last author, and any project that you, dear reader, lead are first author.
