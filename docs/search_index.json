[["index.html", "R Lab Handbook Handbook for the R Computing Lab Welcome to our R Computing Lab and R Lab Handbook Mason Notes", " R Lab Handbook Handbook for the R Computing Lab S. Mason Garrison 2021-07-05 Welcome to our R Computing Lab and R Lab Handbook The R Computing Lab houses scientists who conduct biometrically-informed research in R. Our research addresses a mixture of substantive and methodological questions. Were part of the MegaLab with Veronica Cole! Our substantive work focuses understanding the relationships between socioeconomic status, health &amp; well-being, and individual differences (personality, intelligence). Our methodological work focuses on developing and improving biometrically-informed designs, such as behavior genetic and discordant kin models. Students in the laboratory work on projects covering a wide range of topics including inter-generational consequences of divorce, vaccination willingness, R package development. Mason Notes This website is constantly changing and often in active development. I have made this process explicitly transparent because I want you to see how you can use R to produce some pretty neat things. Indeed, Ive included the source code for this website in the class github. I encourage you to contribute to the course code. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes. If you find cool / useful resources, please add them. How to use these notes This document is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, youll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page. The document will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester. Although these notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give you all a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes do things outside the notes. The idea here is that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you would attend classes and try to learn from them.

Support you in your personal growth, including (but not limited to): giving you flexibility in working hours and environment, and encouraging you to do things other than science. Treat you to coffee and keep the snack drawer filled. Make the time to meet with you regularly, read through your manuscripts, and talk about science. 4.3 Graduate Students I expect graduate students to: - Know the literature related to their topic like the back of their hand. - Seek out and apply for fellowships and awards (including travel awards, etc.). - Realize there are (extraordinarily rare) times for pulling all nighters, and times for leaving early to go to the park and enjoy the sunshine. By the time youre done, you will have to know how to do statistics and plots in R, share your work with me using Rmarkdown, use mplus for latent variable modeling and use github and osf for version control analyses. The learning curve can be a little steep on these but its well worth it. (If these learning outcomes arent compatible with your goals or interests, my lab is probably not a good fit for you!) 4.3.1 General Timeline The timeline below is intended to help you structure your time during the WFU graduate program to stay on track with: - non-coursework program requirements, - professional development opportunities (conferences), and - PhD applications, if you plan to apply.

At a bare minimum, reliability includes showing up on time and making sure that all of your work is accurate (double-check everything). If you find yourself without a specific project: Ask around to see if you can help with anything. Look on the wiki under Essential lab skills and spend some time learning something new. Look on the giant lab todo list for either a wiki page that needs creating/updating, or other miscellaneous lab tasks that need to be done. There is enough to do that you should not be bored! Your first semester in the lab is an opportunity to see whether continuing in the lab is a good fit; after your first semester we will meet and discuss whether you will continue.

These meetings may involve everyone or just subgroups. If you have been asked to participate in a meeting, it is because you are a vital part of that project group. If you cannot attend, you should tell the group leader in advance. Remember, however, that the group may no longer be able to carry out the intended work without your presence, so skip meetings sparingly. If you do not appear at a meeting as expected and have not informed anyone in advance, it will be assumed that you have been abducted by aliens, and a search-and-rescue mission will be organized. I will draw inspiration from Prof. Charlotta Turner of Lund University. All meetings begin and end on time, if not earlier. Dont be afraid to remind me of this if/when I am the offending party. It is important that we all respect each others time. Sources of Adaptation ([2],[3]) 5.1.3 Wiki The lab wiki is our shared collection of knowledge about how to get things done in the lab. The lab manual you are reading now is top down, in that I am writing the whole thing myself. By contrast the wiki is a shared resource to which everyone canand shouldcontribute. A good rule of thumb is that if you need to figure out how to do something, someone else in the lab may someday need to do the same thing. Whenever possible please document what you figure out on the wiki, including updating old sections which may no longer be relevant. Please encourage each other (and those working with you) to do the same! (And me, please remind me!)

If possible, I recommend attending two or more conferences while you are a graduate student at Wake Forest and presenting your research at one or more of the conferences you attend. "],["science.html", "6 Science 6.1 Big picture science 6.2 Practical science 6.3 Computers and data 6.4 Authorship", " 6 Science 6.1 Big picture science 6.1.1 Scientific integrity 6.1.2 Open, accurate, and reproducible science 6.1.2.1 Open science 6.1.2.2 Accurate science 6.2 Practical science 6.3 Computers and data 6.4 Authorship My general philosophy is to be generous and provide ample opportunity for members of the lab to earn authorship. Authorship on an academic work is a public acknowledgment of scientific or professional contribution. Although the criteria for authorship differ slightly across fields, the general question asked is whether this individual made a meaningful contribution to the work. I tend to ask myself had this potential author not been involved in the project, would the final product differed substantially? If the answer to that counter-factual is yes, then I believe that person has earned authorship. 6.4.1 Order of Authors In psychology, the order of authors reflects their relative contribution. Other fields have different conventions, such as economics tends to alphabetize authors. However, psychology and other lab-based fields dont merely rank authors. Instead the authorship order resembles a U where first and last authors indicate the most substantial contributions and authors in the middle reflect relatively smaller contributions. 6.4.2 Authorship on the lab wiki If a lab member makes a meaningful contribution to any page of the OSF website, Ill add them as a bibliographic contributor for that specific page. I encourage you to contribute as well as provide suggestions for additional content. A suggestion by itself doesnt earn authorship, but it is a good start. "],["other.html", "7 Other 7.1 Recommendation letters 7.2 Potential for Controversy", " 7 Other 7.1 Recommendation letters It is part of my job (and, thankfully, quite often a pleasure) to write letters of recommendation for people in the lab. Please give me as much notice as possible, and make sure I know the deadline, format (electronic? printed?), official name of the organization, what you are applying for, and so on. Please also send along a current CV. If you are an undergraduate, I will write your letters on my own. For more senior lab members, I will also write your letters on my own, but please send me a draft of the letter (which I will extensively modify). The first few times you do this it will probably feel awkward. However, keep in mind that your goal is to make it as easy as possible for a letter writer (in this case, me) to complete the task by the deadline and without error. Even though I will re-word a lot of the letter, it will still have the name of what you are applying for and details regarding how long I have known you, the projects you have worked on, and so on. This is extremely helpful in jogging my memory and will give me more time to focus on saying good things about you. Dont worry about being too braggy; I have no problem toning things down if need be. Like everything else, communication is key, and when in doubt, ask! Sources of Adaptation ([2]) 7.2 Potential for Controversy [Internal comment  this issue came to mind because of a conversation I had with Steven Pinker about some of his twitter controversy https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/us/steven-pinker-harvard.html So its on my mind right now ] Many of the research topics in our lab have the potential to be controversial. [disclaimer: controversy can come from the right or left Controversy from the left tends to be XXXX; Controversy from the right tends to be XXXX. We have research questions that can offend both sides. Right offense: LGBTQ; Left offense: genetic effects.] 7.2.1 Topics of Controversy 7.2.1.1 Genetic Effects For example, one of my papers examined the genetic and environmental sources of variance underlying the relationship between socioeconomic status and health (Garrison &amp; Rodgers, 2019). We found that the relationship between physical health and SES was primarily genetic. [paragraph on interpreting genetic effects] 7.2.1.2 Intelligence 7.2.1.3 Historically Marginalized Groups 7.2.1.4 Data Collected Unethically 7.2.2 Causes of Controversy [Misinterpreting findings as racist, sexist, eugenicist, elitist] 7.2.3 Consequences of Controversy The consequences of controversial research can range, here are some examples of increasing severity. The more severe the less common. - uncomfortable conversations - negative media coverage - petitions for removal/revocation of - rescinding of admissions, - jobs offers, - research funding, - awards 7.2.3.1 Relevant Examples (Not an endorsement of their beliefs.) Carl Noah Steven Pinker Charles Murray 7.2.4 Current Strategy Proceed with extreme caution; approach topics very thoughtfully and deliberately. Lay out how these findings can be misinterpreted. I will have your back 1000% on your topic of choice, as long as we do it thoughtfully and without an agenda. This lab does not seek out controversy. This lab focuses on doing good science, and will only delve into controversial areas IF that science has the potential for benefiting the greater good.
